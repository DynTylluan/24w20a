Misc. Author Info       : Been playing Minecraft since 1.8.9 in 2025.

Description             : In Minecraft Java Edition 24w20a, the sounds for
                          the pistons were changed so that they were now
                          quieter and a whole new sound effect was added.
                          From what I understand, this was not a popular
                          update as people saw the original sounds as iconic
                          to the game and this was an unnecessary fix.
                          
                          However, I believe that this was a good change as
                          the normal sound effects... well, they kind of
                          annoy me, especially if I'm AFK in-game. The
                          constant moving of pistons kind of grates me, so I
                          added them back in this pack. Oh joy.
                          
                          This is a very simple resource pack that I don't
                          think I can say all that much else about it.
                          Hopefully, you like the different sounds, if not,
                          oh well.

Additional Credits to   : Mojang itself for making the new sounds. I am
                          unsure about who in the studio *made* the sounds,
                          so this is the best I can give.
